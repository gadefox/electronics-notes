The most suitable pins for digital I/O are D1(GPIO5) and D2(GPIO4).

D5(GPIO14), D4(GPIO12), and D7(GPIO13) pins can be used as digital I/O. The reason is that these pins are for SPI
communications, and if we use them as digital I/O, we won’t need to to use the NodeMCU Board’s SPI Protocol (which
is used for setup and communication by many devices, including some monitors). The SPI limitation won’t be an issue
if the circuit doesn’t have such a component, of course.

D3(GPIO0) and D4(GPIO2) can also function as digital outputs. Remember that the boot process uses these two pins. In
other words, the board won’t boot if these pins are pulled HIGH or LOW by external components such as a relay,
optocoupler, transistor, or any driver model. Setting these pins to LOW will result in the circuit being unable to
boot. These two pins are pulled UP internally. And D3(GPIO0) is connected to the board’s FLASH Button.

We can set TX(GPIO1) as an output, although it is not recommended. This pin serves as the data transmission line
through the serial port, which is also used to communicate with the computer. Plus, it is HIGH during boot, and
changing it to LOW will stop the boot process.

We can use RX(GPIO3) as an input. This pin is the data receiving line through the serial port, which is also used to
communicate with the computer. And it’s also HIGH at boot time.

D0(GPIO16) has no interrupt as a routine input and does not support PWM or I2C as an output. Likewise, it is HIGH at
boot.

We can set D8(GPIO15) as an output. The board won’t be able to boot if it becomes HIGH during boot.
